The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both.
A Git rebase changes the base of the developerâ€™s branch from one commit to another, so it looks like they have created their branch from a different commit.   git rebase --x
Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes.
